This is a discussion on some modern aspects of AdS/CFT, with particular focus on entanglement entropy, bulk reconstruction, and operator algebraic aspects of bulk and boundary subregions. Keep in mind that these are a very informal collection of things that I found interesting, and are in no way meant to be a review or formal introduction whatsoever. In Part One, we will discuss bulk reconstruction and some results surrounding subregions as a motivation towards making sense of tools we will make use of in Part Two and Three. We also mention some details of QES that will be elaborated on more explicitly in Part Two. In Part Two, we will discuss the involvement of quantum extremal surfaces and black hole physics arising from an understanding of subregions and QES. We will talk about QES, purification, pre- and post-Page time behaviour using QES and other related things. In Part Three, we will talk about Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
