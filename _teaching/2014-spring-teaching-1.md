This set of notes contains some things I found interesting about the Poincare conjecture. I must say that I am not an expert, due to which I am not sure when or if at all these notes will be complete. However, this is a very fascinating subject, and I have written these for the sake of capturing some results I found, that discuss some of the more nontrivial aspects of the then Poincare conjecture. 

<h3><a href="https://vkalvakotamath.github.io/files/Poincare-lect-1.pdf">Introduction to the Poincare conjecture and Ricci flow</a></h3>

In this lecture, I will provide a rather informal outlook of the statement of the Poincar´e conjecture – informal in the sense that while I could speak from a topological or PDE perspective, I will stick with a very naive outlook of Ricci flow and the Poincare conjecture. <a href="https://vkalvakotamath.github.io/files/Poincare-lect-1.pdf">files/Poincare-lect-1</a>


<h3><a href="https://vkalvakotamath.github.io/files/Poincare-lect-2.pdf">Poincare conjecture and the h-cobordism theorem</a></h3>

In this lecture, we will look at the h-cobordism theorem and some examples of where it is significant, particularly in understanding the Poincare conjecture. <a href="https://vkalvakotamath.github.io/files/Poincare-lect-2.pdf">files/Poincare-lect-2</a>
