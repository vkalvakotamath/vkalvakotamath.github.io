Hi! My area of work is best described by their corresponding arXiv classifications: **hep-th**, **gr-qc**, **math.DG**, and just recently getting into **math.OA**. Current status: trying to understand bulk reconstruction in dS/CFT and other aspects of operator dictionaries for de Sitter. Essentially, trying to understand de Sitter like we do AdS/CFT, but this is not without problems, and not just ordinary problems -- non-unitary ones. Due to this, we have to understand _timelike_ subregions. One of my motivations was that dS/CFT works the opposite of AdS/CFT -- just tilt your head by 90 degrees to understand the double Wick rotations from AdS to dS, and you will realise that instead of one extrapolate dictionary (like AdS/CFT), there is a differentiate dictionary introduced by Maldacena and an extrapolate dictionary, introduced by Strominger. And so on...
