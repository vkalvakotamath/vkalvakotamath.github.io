Hi! I am working in machine learning and high energy physics theory. My interests are primarily in using statistical mechanics and interesting mathematical models to make LLMs "better" in the sense of sampling methods. I work in de Sitter quantum gravity too, where I am trying to work with von Neumann algebras to obtain some understanding of what a de Sitter subregion duality and holographic correspondence looks like. I am best described by my Github and Twitter bio: Machine Learner. Duner! Interested in understanding ML and why cats are so dangerously cute. Previously and still a high energy theorist. And yes, I love Dune. Did I tell you that? Maybe only a million times before, right?
