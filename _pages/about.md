Hi! My area of work is best described by their corresponding arXiv classifications: **gr-qc**, **math.DG** and **hep-th**. Current status: trying to understand entanglement entropy in dS/CFT and other holographic proposals for de Sitter. Essentially, trying to understand de Sitter like we do AdS/CFT, but this is not without problems, and not just ordinary problems -- non-unitary ones. 

Kindly note that due to some issue with this theme, mobile displays do not show the navigation bar at the top right. Therefore, I have added the links given in this page.
