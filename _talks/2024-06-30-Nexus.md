In this talk, we will review the notion of holography in quantum gravity. We will discuss some subtleties around the definition of holography, and the implications of holography. In the first half, we will discuss some elementary aspects of (A)dS/CFT, some comparisons, and how certain technicalities complicate the general notion of holography as a bulk-(cutoff-)boundary duality. In the second half, we will discuss some aspects in more technical detail, especially in the direction of establishing holography mathematically. 

Based on arXiv:2404.00070 [hep-th] and upcoming work with
Aayush Verma.
