In this talk, we will look at generalized entropy and the generalized second law in the perspective of singularities. We will review the GSL in a cosmological perspective, and find motivation towards the GSL and entropy based singularity theorems. We will see how the fine-grained GSL and the covariant entropy bound provide a physical tool for singularity theorems, replacing topological conditions such as the presence of a non-compact Cauchy surface with instead the quantum focusing conjecture. We will then discuss further aspects of the GSL such as quantum holographic screens in different cosmologies, and if time permits we will provide an outlook for the role of generalized entropy in the asymptotic nature of null hypersurfaces, which will formulate a quantum Penrose inequality for null hypersurfaces on the basis of the generalized entropy.
