A recent paper \cite{Bousso:2022cun} put forward a theorem showing that hyperentropic surface would result in incomplete null generators for a null hypersurface emanating from the surface provided it satisfies the null curvature condition and the spacetime is globally hyperbolic. In this paper, we will put forward a version of this theorem using the quantum expansion in place of the classical expansion, and we will discuss the quantum focusing conjecture in this regard.
