excerpt: 'In this Essay, we will look at the relation between the No Transmission principle and the Strong cosmic censorship (SCC), which we will highlight in the background of quantum gravity. We show that taking quantum gravity into account, one can provide a complete picture of the instability of the inner horizon and the principle that two independent CFTs, under the gauge-gravity duality, imply that the dual bulks must also be independent in that there must not exist a way to transmit a signal between the two spacetimes.'

In this Essay, we will look at the relation between the No Transmission principle and the Strong cosmic censorship (SCC), which we will highlight in the background of quantum gravity. We show that taking quantum gravity into account, one can provide a complete picture of the instability of the inner horizon and the principle that two independent CFTs, under the gauge-gravity duality, imply that the dual bulks must also be independent in that there must not exist a way to transmit a signal between the two spacetimes.
